# Snowchain Project Instructions

This project implements a layered blockchain named Snowchain with the following architecture:

- **Network Layer:** Peer-to-peer nodes for transaction and block propagation.
- **Consensus Layer:** Proof-of-Work (Nakamoto Consensus).
- **Data Layer:** Blockchain as a linked list of hashes.
- **Transaction Layer:** UTXO model (inputs & outputs).
- **Block Layer:** Header and body structure.

## Setup Steps
- Scaffold the project with modules for each layer.
- Implement initial code and documentation for each component.
- Follow best practices for Python project structure.
